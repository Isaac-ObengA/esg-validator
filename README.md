#  ESG Validator – Blockchain-Style Assurance for FinTechs

A Python-based ESG validation tool that uses timestamp hashing and verification logic to improve the integrity of ESG data for cloud-native FinTechs. The prototype aligns with SDR (UK), ISSB S2, and GHG Protocol standards.

##  Why ESG Validator?

FinTechs face challenges like:
- Unverifiable ESG disclosures
- Greenwashing risks
- Limited visibility of Scope 2 & 3 emissions from cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure)

**ESG Validator** helps address this by:
- Validating ESG records for format, completeness, and source
- Generating a SHA-256 signature to ensure tamper-proof records
- Simulating dashboard outputs (Power BI-style) for emissions, stakeholder feedback, and audit logs

##  Features

-  Python-based ESG validation logic
-  SHA-256 hashing signature
-  Structured audit logs (accepted/rejected entries)
-  SDR/ISSB alignment
-  Stakeholder-informed logic (Freeman’s Stakeholder Theory)
